# homebrew-gecode
A Homebrew tap for gecode (allowing gist compilation).

Indeed, homebrew-core/gecode is missing the qt dependency and the gist compilation (because core formulae couldn't contain optional/recommended dependencies).

The purpose of this repository is to overcome this limit, having a fully working gecode installation supporting gist.
